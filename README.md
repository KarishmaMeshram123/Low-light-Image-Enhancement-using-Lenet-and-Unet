# Low-light-Image-Enhancement-using-Lenet-and-Unet

This project implements a **hybrid deep learning model** that combines **LeNet** (for feature extraction) and **U-Net** (for image-to-image enhancement).  
The model enhances visibility and preserves details in images captured under low-light conditions.

---

## ✨ Features
- Hybrid architecture: LeNet + U-Net
- Enhances low-light images into clearer, brighter outputs
- Evaluation metrics: **PSNR**, **SSIM**
- Implemented in **Google Colab** for easy training and testing

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Scikit-Image

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `LowLightEnhancement_Hybrid.ipynb` → Colab notebook with model code & training pipeline  
- `requirements.txt` → dependencies (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, etc.)  

## 📊 Dataset
This project uses the **LOL (Low-Light) Dataset** for training and testing.  
Since the dataset is large, it is not uploaded here.
